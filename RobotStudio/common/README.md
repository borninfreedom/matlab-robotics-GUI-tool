## Synopsis

Common code for MATLAB toolboxes for Robotics and Machine Vision.


## Motivation

A collection of utility functions that factor out common tasks for the toolboxes.

## Installation

Relevant files are included in the distributions of Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB (RTB) and Machine Vision Toolbox for MATLAB (MVTB).

To use this, my development repo, directly:
  * clone this repo
  * clone RTB or MVTB
  * clone Spatial Math Toolbox for MATLAB
  * ensure that all are in your MATLAB path
  
## API Reference

Built as part of Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB or Machine Vision Toolbox for MATLAB.
