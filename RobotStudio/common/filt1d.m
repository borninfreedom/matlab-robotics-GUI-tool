%FILT1D    1-dimensional rank filter
%
% Y = FILT1D(X, OPTIONS) is the minimum, maximum or median value (1xN) of the 
% vector X (1xN) compute over an odd length sliding window.
%
% Options::
% 'max'        Compute maximum value over the window (default)
% 'min'        Compute minimum value over the window
% 'median'     Compute minimum value over the window
% 'width',W    Width of the window (default 5)
%
% Notes::
% - If the window width is even, it is incremented by one.
% - The first and last elements of X are replicated so the output vector is the
%   same length as the input vector.
