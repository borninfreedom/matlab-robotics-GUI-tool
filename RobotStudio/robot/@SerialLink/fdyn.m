%SerialLink.fdyn Integrate forward dynamics
%
% [T,Q,QD] = R.fdyn(TMAX, FTFUN) integrates the dynamics of the robot over
% the time  interval 0 to TMAX and returns vectors of time T (Kx1), joint
% position Q (KxN) and joint velocity QD (KxN).  The initial joint position
% and velocity are zero. The torque applied to the joints is computed by
% the user-supplied control function FTFUN:
%
%        TAU = FTFUN(ROBOT, T, Q, QD)
%
% where TAU (1xN) is the joint torques to be applied at this time instant,
% ROBOT is the robot object being simulated, T is the current time, and Q
% (1xN) and QD (1xN) are the manipulator joint coordinate and velocity
% state respectively.
%
% [TI,Q,QD] = R.fdyn(T, FTFUN, Q0, QD0) as above but allows the initial
% joint position Q0 (1xN) and velocity QD0 (1x)  to be specified.
%
% [T,Q,QD] = R.fdyn(T1, FTFUN, Q0, QD0, ARG1, ARG2, ...) allows optional 
% arguments to be passed through to the user-supplied control function:
%
%        TAU = FTFUN(ROBOT, T, Q, QD, ARG1, ARG2, ...)
%
% For example, if the robot was controlled by a PD controller we can define
% a function to compute the control
%
%         function tau = myftfun(q, qd, qstar, P, D)
%           tau = (qstar-q)*P + qd*D;  % P, D are 6x6
%         end
%
% and then integrate the robot dynamics with the control:
%
%         [t,q] = robot.fdyn(10, @(robot, t, q, qd) myftfun(q, qd, qstar, P, D) );
%
% where the lambda function ignores the passed values of robot and t but
% adds qstar, P and D to argument list for myftfun.
%
% Note::
% - This function performs poorly with non-linear joint friction, such as
%   Coulomb friction.  The R.nofriction() method can be used to set this 
%   friction to zero.
% - If FTFUN is not specified, or is given as [],  then zero torque
%   is applied to the manipulator joints.
% - The MATLAB builtin integration function ode45() is used.
%
