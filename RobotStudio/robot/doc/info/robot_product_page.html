<h1 style="color:red; margin-bottom:0;">Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB</h1>
<hr style="margin-top:; 0;">
Tools for robot manipulators and mobile robots
<p>
This, the tenth major release of the Toolbox, representing over twenty years of continuous
development and a substantial level of maturity.
This version corresponds to the <b>second edition</b> of the book <a href="http://www.petercorke.com/rvc">&ldquo;<it>Robotics, Vision &amp; Control</it>&rdquo;</a> published in 2017.
</p><p>
This Toolbox has a rich collection of functions that are useful for the study and simulation
of robots:  arm-type robot manipulators and mobile robots.
For robot manipulators functions include kinematics, trajectory generation, dynamics and  control.
For mobile robots functions path planning algorithms, kinodynamic planning, 
localization, map building and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM).
</p><p>
The Toolbox makes strong use of classes to represent robots and such things as sensors and maps.
It includes Simulink models to describe the evolution of robot state over time for a number of classical control
strategies. The Toolbox also provides functions for manipulating and converting between datatypes such as vectors, homogeneous transformations and unit-quaternions which are necessary to represent  position and orientation in 2- and
3-dimensions.
</p><p>
The code is written in a straightforward manner which allows
for easy understanding, perhaps at the expense of computational efficiency.
If you feel strongly about computational efficiency then you can always
rewrite the function to be more efficient.
