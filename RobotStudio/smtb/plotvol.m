%PLOTVOL Set the bounds for a 2D or 3D plot
%
% 2D plots::
%
% PLOTVOL([WX WY]) creates a new axis, and sets the bounds for a 2D plot,
% with X spanning [-WX, WX] and Y spanning [-WY,WY].
%
% PLOTVOL([XMIN XMAX YMIN YMAX]) as above but the X and Y axis limits are explicitly provided.
%
% 3D plots::
%
% PLOTVOL(W) creates a new axis, and sets the bounds for a 3D plot with X, Y and Z spanning
% the interval -W to W.  
%
% PLOTVOL([WX WY WZ]) as above with X spanning [-WX, WX], Y spanning [-WY, WY] and Z 
% spanning [-WZ, WZ].
%
% Notes::
% - The axes are labelled, grid is enabled, aspect ratio set to 1:1.
% - Hold is enabled for subsequent plots.
%
% See also: axis.

%
% PLOTVOL([XMIN XMAX YMIN YMAX ZMIN ZMAX]) as above but the X, Y and Z axis limits are
% explicitly provided.
