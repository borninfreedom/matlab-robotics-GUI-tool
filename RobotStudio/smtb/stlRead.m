%STLREAD Reads STL file
%
% [v, f, n, objname] = stlRead(fileName) reads the STL format file (ASCII or
% binary) and returns: 
%
% V (Mx3)   each row is the 3D coordinate of a vertex
% F (Nx3)   each row is a list of vertex indices that defines a triangular face 
% N (Nx3)   each row is a unit-vector defining the face normal
% OBJNAME   is the name of the STL object (NOT the name of the STL file).
