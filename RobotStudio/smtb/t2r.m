%T2R Rotational submatrix
%
% R = T2R(T) is the orthonormal rotation matrix component of homogeneous
% transformation matrix T.  Works for T in SE(2) or SE(3)
% - If T is 4x4, then R is 3x3.
% - If T is 3x3, then R is 2x2.
%
% Notes::
% - For a homogeneous transform sequence (KxKxN) returns a rotation matrix
%   sequence (K-1xK-1xN).
% - The validity of rotational part is not checked
%
% See also R2T, TR2RT, RT2TR.
