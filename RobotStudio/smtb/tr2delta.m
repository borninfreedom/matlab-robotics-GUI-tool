%TR2DELTA Convert SE(3) homogeneous transform to differential motion
%
% D = TR2DELTA(T0, T1) is the differential motion (6x1) corresponding to 
% infinitessimal motion (in the T0 frame) from pose T0 to T1 which are homogeneous 
% transformations (4x4) or SE3 objects.
%
% The vector D=(dx, dy, dz, dRx, dRy, dRz) represents infinitessimal translation
% and rotation, and is an approximation to the instantaneous spatial velocity 
% multiplied by time step.
%
% D = TR2DELTA(T) as above but the motion is from the world frame to the SE3
% pose T.
%
% Notes::
% - D is only an approximation to the motion T, and assumes
%   that T0 ~ T1 or T ~ eye(4,4).
% - Can be considered as an approximation to the effect of spatial velocity over a
%   a time interval, average spatial velocity multiplied by time.
