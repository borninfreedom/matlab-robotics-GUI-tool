%TR2EUL Convert SO(3) or SE(3) matrix to Euler angles
%
% EUL = TR2EUL(T, OPTIONS) are the ZYZ Euler angles (1x3) corresponding to
% the rotational part of a homogeneous transform T (4x4). The 3 angles
% EUL=[PHI,THETA,PSI] correspond to sequential rotations about the Z, Y and
% Z axes respectively.
%
% EUL = TR2EUL(R, OPTIONS) as above but the input is an orthonormal
% rotation matrix R (3x3).
%
% If R (3x3xK) or T (4x4xK) represent a sequence then each row of EUL
% corresponds to a step of the sequence.
%
% Options::
%  'deg'      Compute angles in degrees (radians default)
%  'flip'     Choose first Euler angle to be in quadrant 2 or 3.
%
% Notes::
% - There is a singularity for the case where THETA=0 in which case PHI is arbitrarily
%   set to zero and PSI is the sum (PHI+PSI).
% - Translation component is ignored.
