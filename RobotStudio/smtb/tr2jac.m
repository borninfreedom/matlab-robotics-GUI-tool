%TR2JAC Jacobian for differential motion
%
% J = TR2JAC(TAB) is a Jacobian matrix (6x6) that maps spatial velocity or
% differential motion from frame {A} to frame {B} where the pose of {B}
% relative to {A} is represented by the homogeneous transform TAB (4x4).
%
% J = TR2JAC(TAB, 'samebody') is a Jacobian matrix (6x6) that maps spatial
% velocity or differential motion from frame {A} to frame {B} where both
% are attached to the same moving body.  The pose of {B} relative to {A} is
% represented by the homogeneous transform TAB (4x4).
