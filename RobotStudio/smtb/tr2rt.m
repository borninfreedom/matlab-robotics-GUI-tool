%TR2RT Convert homogeneous transform to rotation and translation 
%
% [R,t] = TR2RT(TR) splits a homogeneous transformation matrix (NxN) into an 
% orthonormal rotation matrix R (MxM) and a translation vector t (Mx1), where
% N=M+1.
%
% Works for TR in SE(2) or SE(3)
%  - If TR is 4x4, then R is 3x3 and T is 3x1.
%  - If TR is 3x3, then R is 2x2 and T is 2x1.
%
% A homogeneous transform sequence TR (NxNxK) is split into rotation matrix 
% sequence R (MxMxK) and a translation sequence t (KxM).
%
%
% Notes::
% - The validity of R is not checked.

% See also RT2TR, R2T, T2R.
