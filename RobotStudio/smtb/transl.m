%TRANSL SE(3) translational homogeneous transform
%
% Create a translational SE(3) matrix::
%
% T = TRANSL(X, Y, Z) is an SE(3) homogeneous transform (4x4) representing
% a pure translation of X, Y and Z.
%
% T = TRANSL(P) is an SE(3) homogeneous transform (4x4) representing a
% translation of P=[X,Y,Z]. P (Mx3) represents a sequence and T
% (4x4xM) is a sequence of homogeneous transforms such that T(:,:,i)
% corresponds to the i'th row of P.
%
% Extract the translational part of an SE(3) matrix::
%
% P = TRANSL(T) is the translational part of a homogeneous transform T as a
% 3-element column vector.  T (4x4xM) is a homogeneous transform
% sequence and the rows of P (Mx3) are the translational component of the
% corresponding transform in the sequence.
%
% [X,Y,Z] = TRANSL(T) is the translational part of a homogeneous transform
% T as three components.  If T (4x4xM) is a homogeneous transform sequence
% then X,Y,Z (1xM) are the translational components of the corresponding
% transform in the sequence.
%
% Notes::
% - Somewhat unusually, this function performs a function and its inverse.  An
%   historical anomaly.
