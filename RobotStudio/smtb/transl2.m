%TRANSL2 SE(2) translational homogeneous transform
%
% Create a translational SE(2) matrix::
%
% T = TRANSL2(X, Y) is an SE(2) homogeneous transform (3x3) representing a
% pure translation.
%
% T = TRANSL2(P) is a homogeneous transform representing a translation or
% point P=[X,Y]. P (Mx2) represents a sequence and T (3x3xM) is a
% sequence of homogenous transforms such that T(:,:,i) corresponds to the
% i'th row of P.
%
% Extract the translational part of an SE(2) matrix::
%
% P = TRANSL2(T) is the translational part of a homogeneous transform as a
% 2-element column vector.  T (3x3xM) is a homogeneous transform
% sequence and the rows of P (Mx2) are the translational component of the
% corresponding transform in the sequence.
%
% Notes::
% - Somewhat unusually, this function performs a function and its inverse.  An
%   historical anomaly.
