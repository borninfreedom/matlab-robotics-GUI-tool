%TRINTERP Interpolate SE(3) homogeneous transformations
%
% TRINTERP(T0, T1, S) is a homogeneous transform (4x4) interpolated
% between T0 when S=0 and T1 when S=1.  T0 and T1 are both homogeneous
% transforms (4x4).  If S (Nx1) then T (4x4xN) is a sequence of
% homogeneous transforms corresponding to the interpolation values in S.
%
% TRINTERP(T1, S) as above but interpolated between the identity matrix
% when S=0 to T1 when S=1.
%
% TRINTERP(T0, T1, M) as above but M is a positive integer and return a
% sequence (4x4xM) of homogeneous transforms linearly interpolating between 
% T0 and T1 in M steps.
%
% TRINTERP(T1, M) as above but return a sequence (4x4xM) of
% homogeneous interpolating between identity matrix and T1 in M steps.
%
% Notes::
% - T0 or T1 can also be an SO(3) rotation matrix (3x3) in which case the
%   result is (3x3xN).
% - Rotation is interpolated using quaternion spherical linear interpolation (slerp).
% - To obtain smooth continuous motion S should also be smooth and continuous,
%   such as computed by tpoly or lspb.
