%TRLOG Logarithm of SO(3) or SE(3) matrix
%
% S = trlog(R) is the matrix logarithm (3x3) of R (3x3) which is a skew
% symmetric matrix corresponding to the vector theta*w where theta is the
% rotation angle and w (3x1) is a unit-vector indicating the rotation axis.
%
% [theta,w] = trlog(R) as above but returns directly theta the rotation
% angle and w (3x1) the unit-vector indicating the rotation axis.
%
% S = trlog(T) is the matrix logarithm (4x4) of T (4x4) which has a 
% skew-symmetric upper-left 3x3 submatrix corresponding to the vector
% theta*w where theta is the rotation angle and w (3x1) is a unit-vector
% indicating the rotation axis, and a translation component.
%
% [theta,twist] = trlog(T) as above but returns directly theta the rotation
% angle and a twist vector (6x1) comprising [v w].
%
% Notes::
% - Efficient closed-form solution of the matrix logarithm for arguments that are
%   SO(3) or SE(3).
% - Special cases of rotation by odd multiples of pi are handled.
% - Angle is always in the interval [0,pi].
% - There is no Toolbox function for SO(2) or SE(2), use LOGM instead.
