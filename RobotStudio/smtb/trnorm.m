%TRNORM Normalize an SO(3) or SE(3) matrix
%
% TRNORM(R) is guaranteed to be a proper orthogonal matrix rotation
% matrix (3x3) which is "close" to the input matrix R (3x3). If R
% = [N,O,A] the O and A vectors are made unit length and the normal vector
% is formed from N = O x A, and then we ensure that O and A are orthogonal
% by O = A x N.
%
% TRNORM(T) as above but the rotational submatrix of the homogeneous
% transformation T (4x4) is normalised while the translational part is
% unchanged.
%
% If R (3x3xK) or T (4x4xK) representing a sequence then the normalisation
% is performed on each of the K planes.
%
% Notes::
% - Only the direction of A (the z-axis) is unchanged.
% - Used to prevent finite word length arithmetic causing transforms to 
%   become `unnormalized'.
% - There is no Toolbox function for SO(2) or SE(2).
