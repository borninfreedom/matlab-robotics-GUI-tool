%TROT2 SE(2) rotation matrix
%
% T = TROT2(THETA) is a homogeneous transformation (3x3) representing a rotation 
% of THETA radians.
%
% T = TROT2(THETA, 'deg') as above but THETA is in degrees.
%
% Notes::
% - Translational component is zero.
%
% See also rot2, transl2, ishomog2, trplot2, trotx, troty, trotz, SE2.
