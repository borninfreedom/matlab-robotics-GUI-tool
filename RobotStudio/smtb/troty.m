%troty SE(3) rotation about Y axis
%
% T = troty(THETA) is a homogeneous transformation (4x4) representing a rotation 
% of THETA radians about the y-axis.
%
% T = troty(THETA, 'deg') as above but THETA is in degrees.
%
% Notes::
% - Translational component is zero.
%
% See also roty, trotx, trotz, trot2, SE3.Ry.
