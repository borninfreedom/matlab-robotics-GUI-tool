%TRSCALE Homogeneous transformation for pure scale
%
% T = TRSCALE(S) is a homogeneous transform (4x4) corresponding to a pure
% scale change.  If S is a scalar the same scale factor is used for x,y,z,
% else it can be a 3-vector specifying scale in the x-, y- and
% z-directions.

% - This matrix does not belong to SE(3) and should not be compounded with
%   any SE(3) matrix.
